## About the Collection

Sorry, fellow book nerds, your TBR stack (who are we kidding, stacks) is about to get a little taller. Making recommendations is my favorite part of my job as a bookseller, so I’ve gathered some of my recent favorites here, along with my reviews. All selections are intended for an adult audience. Fans of literary fiction, fantasy, social and political commentary, nonfiction history, or just really phenomenal writing will find something they’ll like here. Find them at your library or get them from your local independent bookstore!

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
