book_001,sky_daddy,Sky Daddy,Kate Folk,"April 8, 2025",Random House,Fiction,9780593231494,$29,hardcover,Air travel--Fiction; Domestic fiction; Female friendship in literature; Eccentrics in literature,"Linda's life may appear drab to those around her: She makes $20 an hour as a content moderator, flagging comments that violate a tech conglomerate's terms and conditions. Every night, she returns to the windowless room she rents in a garage on the outskirts of San Francisco. But once a month, she indulges her true passion: taking the AirTrain to SFO for a clandestine meeting on the cheapest flight out that night. Linda isn't interested in pilots, though. She has a thing for planes; their intelligent windscreens, comely slats, and rumbling turbulence make her feel a way that no man ever could. In fact, she desperately believes her destiny is to marry one by uniting their souls for eternity in what the rest of us may vulgarly refer to as a plane crash-the fatal tailspin caused by the plane's uncontrollable desire for her. Linda's unusual proclivities distance her from the rest of humanity, so she's surprised and pleased when her charismatic work friend, Karina, invites her to a quarterly Vision Board Brunch. She wants to hasten her romantic fate through manifestation, but as her vision boards start coming true a bit too literally, Linda must choose between being her authentic self or abandoning her destiny for a more ""normal"" life.","Listen, you might not think you need to read a book about a woman who's sexually attracted to airplanes, but I am here to tell you otherwise. I picked this up on a lark because of the bonkers premise; what a delightful surprise to find that it hits so much deeper than I anticipated. Linda and her, uh, unusual romantic preferences are portrayed with empathy and humanity, and Kate Folk's writing is sharp, precise, and wryly funny. This book is just as bizarre as you expect it to be, but so much more."
book_002,martyr,Martyr!,Kaveh Akbar,"December 31, 2024",Vintage,Fiction,9780593685778,$18,paperback,"American literature--Iranian American authors; Drug addiction in literature; Death in literature; Psychological fiction, American","Cyrus Shams is a young man grappling with an inheritance of violence and loss: his mother’s plane was shot down over the skies of the Persian Gulf in a senseless accident; and his father’s life in America was circumscribed by his work killing chickens at a factory farm in the Midwest. Cyrus is a drunk, an addict, and a poet, whose obsession with martyrs leads him to examine the mysteries of his past—toward an uncle who rode through Iranian battlefields dressed as the angel of death to inspire and comfort the dying, and toward his mother, through a painting discovered in a Brooklyn art gallery that suggests she may not have been who or what she seemed. Kaveh Akbar’s Martyr! is a paean to how we spend our lives seeking meaning—in faith, art, ourselves, others.","I honestly have a hard time verbalizing exactly what I love about this novel, except to say that I am writing this review months after reading it because it's still on my mind. Cyrus Shams was a baby when his mother's plane was shot down over the Persian Gulf. Following her death, Cyrus and his father move to Indiana; his father dies as Cyrus is beginning college. Mired in grief, suffering from depression, addiction, and insomnia, Cyrus develops a fascination with death and martyrs that leads him to Orkideh, a performance artist whose final installation is her slow death by cancer on display in a gallery. Akbar is a poet, but this debut demonstrates his unparalleled mastery of prose. Despite often heavy subject matter, Martyr! is whimsical, full of moments of humor and light that make for a stunning exploration of what it means to live and die meaningfully."
book_003,book_and_dagger,Book and Dagger: How Scholars and Librarians Became the Unlikely Spies of World War II,Elyse Graham,"September 24, 2024",Ecco,History-World War II,9780063280847,$30,hardcover,"Espionage, American; World War, 1939-1945; College teachers; Librarians; Archivists; History","The untold story of the academics who became OSS spies, invented modern spycraft, and helped turn the tide of the war. At the start of WWII, the US found itself in desperate need of an intelligence agency. The Office of Strategic Services (OSS), a precursor to today's CIA, was quickly formed--and, in an effort to fill its ranks with experts, the OSS turned to academia for recruits. Suddenly, literature professors, librarians, and historians were training to perform undercover operations and investigative work--and these surprising spies would go on to profoundly shape both the course of the war and our cultural institutions with their efforts. In Book and Dagger, Elyse Graham draws on personal histories, diaries, and declassified OSS files to tell the story of a small but connected group of humanities scholars turned unlikely spies. Among them are Joseph Curtiss, a literature professor who hunted down German spies and turned them into double agents; Sherman Kent, a smart-mouthed history professor who rose to become the head of analysis for all of Europe and Africa; and Adele Kibre, an archivist who was sent to Stockholm to secretly acquire documents for the OSS. These unforgettable characters would ultimately help lay the foundations of modern intelligence and transform American higher education when they returned after the war. Thrillingly paced and rigorously researched, Book and Dagger is an inspiring and gripping true story about a group of academics who helped beat the Nazis--a tale that reveals the indelible power of humanities to change the world.","At the dawn of WWII, the US recruited for its nascent intelligence program not suave, Bond-esque career spies, but academics, librarians, and archivists, whose skills in research and information analysis contributed to the Allied victory. Despite the unassuming and relatively quiet nature of these new intelligence agents' day jobs, this impeccably researched account is just as pulse-pounding as any spy thriller."
book_004,greenteeth,Greenteeth,Molly O'Neill,"February 25, 2025",Orbit,Fantasy,9780316584241,$18.99,paperback,Fantasy fiction; Women--England--Fiction; Friendship in literature; Sea monsters in literature; Witches; Goblins; Magic; Good and evil in literature,"Beneath the still surface of a lake lurks a monster with needle sharp teeth. Hungry and ready to pounce. Jenny Greenteeth has never spoken to a human before, but when a witch is thrown into her lake, something makes Jenny decide she's worth saving. Temperance doesn't know why her village has suddenly turned against her, only that it has something to do with the malevolent new pastor. Though they have nothing in common, these two must band together on a magical quest to defeat the evil that threatens Jenny's lake and Temperance's family, as well as the very soul of Britain.","I never knew that ""you are amusingly soft-hearted for a villainous swamp creature"" was the sort of affirmation I wanted out of a friendship, but honestly, may we all be so lucky as to have a friend like Brackus the goblin. Jenny Greenteeth only wants to spend her days tidying up her lake, snacking on rotten fish, and occasionally frightening the local villagers (she doesn't usually eat children, but she could). But when her small English village is infiltrated by an ancient, unspeakable evil, Jenny teams up with a human witch and a goblin salesman (salesgoblin?) to defeat the threat. Greenteeth is a delightful quest tale that draws on Arthurian legend and other familiar British Isles folklore while still feeling fresh and original. It strikes a fine balance between cozy and high stakes, our unlikely trio's friendship feels genuine, and Jenny the lake monster is just the type of prickly, morally gray narrator that I love."
book_005,el_akkad,"One Day, Everyone Will Have Always Been Against This",Omar El Akkad,"February 13, 2025",Knopf,Autobiography,9780593804148,$28,hardcover,"Palestine; Israel-Hamas War, 2023-; El Akkad, Omar, 1982-; Journalism","On October 25, 2023, after just three weeks of the bombardment of Gaza, Omar El Akkad put out a tweet: “One day, when it’s safe, when there’s no personal downside to calling a thing what it is, when it’s too late to hold anyone accountable, everyone will have always been against this.” This tweet has been viewed more than 10 million times. As an immigrant who came to the West, El Akkad believed that it promised freedom. A place of justice for all. But in the past twenty years, reporting on the War on Terror, Ferguson, climate change, Black Lives Matter protests, and more, and watching the unmitigated slaughter in Gaza, El Akkad has come to the conclusion that much of what the West promises is a lie. That there will always be entire groups of human beings it has never intended to treat as fully human—not just Arabs or Muslims or immigrants, but whoever falls outside the boundaries of privilege. One Day, Everyone Will Have Always Been Against This is a chronicle of that painful realization, a moral grappling with what it means, as a citizen of the U.S., as a father, to carve out some sense of possibility in a time of carnage. This is El Akkad’s nonfiction debut, his most raw and vulnerable work to date, a heartsick breakup letter with the West. It is a brilliant articulation of the same breakup we are watching all over the United States, in family rooms, on college campuses, on city streets; the consequences of this rupture are just beginning. This book is for all the people who want something better than what the West has served up. This is the book for our time.","An absolutely devastating, infuriating, chastening, and necessary lamentation of the West’s response to and active participation in the genocide of Palestinians. In stunning prose, El Akkad rightfully lambasts Westerners for the inhumane ease with which we look away from, and even facilitate, mass-scale cruelty. Everyone should read this."
book_006,nicked,Nicked,M. T. Anderson,"July 23, 2024",Pantheon,Fiction,"9780593701607,",$28,hardcover,Historical fiction; Fantasy fiction; Eleventh century; Adventure and adventurers in literature; LGBTQ+ characters; Catholic Church,"The year is 1087, and a pox is sweeping through the Italian port city of Bari. When a lowly monk is visited by Saint Nicholas in his dreams, he interprets the vision as a call to action. But his superiors, and the power brokers they serve, have different plans for the tender-hearted Brother Nicephorus. Enter Tyun, a charismatic treasure hunter renowned for ""liberating"" holy relics from their tombs. The six-hundred-year-old bones of Saint Nicholas rest in distant Myra, Tyun explains, and they're rumored to weep a mysterious liquid that can heal the sick. For the humble price of a small fortune, Tyun will steal the bones and deliver them to Bari, curing the plague and restoring glory to the fallen city. And Nicephorus, the ""dreamer,"" will be his guide. What follows is a heist for the ages, as Nicephorus is swept away on strange tides-and alongside even stranger bedfellows-to commit an act of sacrilege. Based on real historical accounts, Nicked is a wildly imaginative, genre-defying, and delightfully queer adventure, full of romance, intrigue, and wide-eyed wonder at the world that awaits beyond our own borders","I loved this weird, whimsical book. Part historical fiction, part rollicking heist novel, part queer love story, it also has elements of fantasy while remaining solidly grounded in accounts of real events and contemporary writings on the medieval practice of religious relic theft. This book has everything—monks, scoundrels, a dog-headed man, battles at sea, a mob of angry villagers, and plenty of humor."
book_007,by-the-fire-we-carry,By the Fire We Carry : The Generations-Long Fight for Justice on Native Land,Rebecca Nagle,"September 10, 2024",Harper,History-Indigenous,9780063112049,$32,hardcover,Indigenous history; Native Americans; Treaties; Muscogee Nation; Constitutional courts,"Before 2020, American Indian reservations made up roughly 55 million acres of land in the United States. Nearly 200 million acres are reserved for National Forests—in the emergence of this great nation, our government set aside more land for trees than for Indigenous peoples. In the 1830s Muscogee people were rounded up by the US military at gunpoint and forced into exile halfway across the continent. At the time, they were promised this new land would be theirs for as long as the grass grew and the waters ran. But that promise was not kept. When Oklahoma was created on top of Muscogee land, the new state claimed their reservation no longer existed. Over a century later, a Muscogee citizen was sentenced to death for murdering another Muscogee citizen on tribal land. His defense attorneys argued the murder occurred on the reservation of his tribe, and therefore Oklahoma didn’t have the jurisdiction to execute him. Oklahoma asserted that the reservation no longer existed. In the summer of 2020, the Supreme Court settled the dispute. Its ruling that would ultimately underpin multiple reservations covering almost half the land in Oklahoma, including Nagle’s own Cherokee Nation. Here Rebecca Nagle recounts the generations-long fight for tribal land and sovereignty in eastern Oklahoma. By chronicling both the contemporary legal battle and historic acts of Indigenous resistance, By the Fire We Carry stands as a landmark work of American history. The story it tells exposes both the wrongs that our nation has committed and the Native-led battle for justice that has shaped our country.","In 2020, the Supreme Court affirmed the reservation of Muscogee Nation in a stunning victory for Indigenous land rights. Alternating between the case and the wider history of tribal sovereignty, removal, and resistance in Oklahoma, By the Fire We Carry is an engaging, infuriating account of Indigenous people's ongoing fight to exist on their own land. As a journalist, Nagle's writing is clear, accessible, and impeccably researched, and as a member of Cherokee Nation her grief and rage at the historic and contemporary treatment of Indigenous people is unflinchingly honest."
